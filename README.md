## Project Synopsis:
Audio denoising web application used for removing background noise from audio files
## Project Description:
  The project we will be doing this year is denoising an audio file. The simple idea is that you feed a noisy
file, a file with background noise such as loud voices or loud cars, into the model and it will give you the same
audio file except without the noise.

  This project is being undertaken because it is still a real world problem in how to properly denoise an
audio file. Even more specific, this is a real world problem in the realm of hearing aids. Hearing aids amplify
every signal coming in, instead of important ones such as someone talking to you. By undertaking this project
we hope to find a way to not only remove the background noise, but to enhance important signals such as
people talking.

  The end goal of this project can either go two ways. It can be implemented on a website so that people
may upload audio files they wish to denoise or it can be implemented onto an embedded system, such as
hearing aids. Later in this semester we will narrow down our choice and decide which route we will go down.
